                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>Obutonde Bwaffe was established in 2025 by a group of passionate MRU students in the Faculty of Education, concerned about environment Conservation in Uganda. What will  begin as a small campus tree-planting club will grow into a university-wide initiative with multiple projects and community partnerships.</p>
                
                <p>Our name, "Obutonde Bwaffe," was carefully chosen to reflect both our Buganda heritage and our collective responsibility. It reminds us that the environment doesn't belong to us - we belong to it, and we must care for it as we would our own home.</p>
